# Heart-Disease-Predictions
A machine learning project designed to predict heart disease risk based on patient health metrics using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The model analyzes key indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and age to deliver accurate predictions. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis and medical decision-making.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a patient is at risk for heart disease. This model could potentially be used in medical settings to assist healthcare providers in making early interventions based on patient data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several health-related features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., which are key indicators for heart disease. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical features.

Source: The dataset was obtained from [insert source here].
Features: 13 independent variables including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, etc.
Target Variable: Presence or absence of heart disease.
Features
Age: Age of the patient.
Sex: Gender of the patient.
Chest pain type: Type of chest pain experienced.
Resting blood pressure: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
Fasting blood sugar: If fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.
Resting ECG: Results of resting electrocardiographic measurements.
Max heart rate: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
Exercise-induced angina: Exercise-induced chest pain.
ST depression: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Slope of the peak exercise ST segment: The slope during peak exercise.
Number of major vessels: Number of major blood vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
Thalassemia: Blood disorder affecting hemoglobin levels.
Modeling Techniques
The project explores various machine learning algorithms to build the heart disease prediction model, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
